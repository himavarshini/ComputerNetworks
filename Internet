1) Nuts and Bolts view:
--> Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of
    computing devices through out the world.
--> Computing devices - "Hosts" or "endsystems"
    Traditional: Desktop PCs, Linux workstations and servers that store and 
    transmit information such as Webpages and e-mail messages.
    Non-traditional Internet end systems: Laptops, smartphones, TVs, gaming
    consoles, Web cams, automobiles, environmental sensing devices, picture
    frames, home electrical and security systems
--> End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and
    packet switches
--> Transmission rate - bits/second
--> When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end
system segments the data and adds header bytes to the segments
        The resulting packages of information are known as "packets".
--> Packets are then sent through the network to the destination end system,
    where they are reassembled into original data.
--> 'Packet switch' takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.
--> Two most prominent packet switches in today's Internet
                                      used in
      --> routers                   network core
      --> link-layer switches      access networks
--> Sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet
from the sending end system to receiving end system is known as route or path
--> Packet-switched networks similar to transportation networks of highways,
reads and intersections.
